# Simple Shooter

Now, make a simple space shooter.

I use the `gui` for generic words, `vesprite` for vector graphics, `part16` for particle system, `penner` for penner animation (tranform inteval 0..1 in diferent times) and draws.vsp for make graphics, in this case i download a svg sheet of space graphics and import with the editor the selected ones.

```
^r4/lib/gui.txt
^r4/lib/vesprite.txt
^r4/lib/part16.txt
^r4/lib/penner.txt
^./draws.vsp
```

lets define 3 particle systems, for aliens, for bullets and for fx, I use deferent collection because fx not collide with others, bullets collide with aliens.

```
#aliens 0 0
#shoot 0 0
#fx 0 0
```

The players is one, I define Y position, X position, X velocity and X aceletarion

```
#yp -0.8
#xp
#xv
#xa
```

Try to make modification to acceleration with keys and use the velocity for angle of ship too.

From botton to up.
Define memory for particles, a paper color and call main.

```
:memory
	$cccccc 'paper !
	mark
	200 'aliens p.ini
	200 'shoot p.ini
	200 'fx p.ini
	;

: memory main ;
```
